# Credit-Risk-Modeling
Credit risk arises when a corporate or individual borrower fails to meet their debt obligations. It is the probability that the lender will not receive the principal and interest payments of a debt required to service the debt extended to a borrower.
On the side of the lender, credit risk will disrupt its cash flows and also increase collection costs, since the lender may be forced to hire a debt collection agency to enforce the collection. The loss may be partial or complete, where the lender incurs a loss of part of the loan or the entire loan extended to the borrower.
Financial institutions used credit risk analysis models to determine the probability of default of a potential borrower. The models provide information on the level of a borrowerâ€™s credit risk at any particular time. If the lender fails to detect the credit risk in advance, it exposes them to the risk of default and loss of funds. Lenders rely on the validation provided by credit risk analysis models to make key lending decisions on whether or not to extend credit to the borrower and the credit to be charged.
In this notebook we are going to explore the data cleaning and transformation as well as machine learing modeling in predicting probability of default. We will then use these results to develop a credit rating.
Further we will explore the callibration and validation of the developed model to assess compliance with industry benchmarks and regulatory requirements.
